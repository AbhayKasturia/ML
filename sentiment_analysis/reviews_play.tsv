1	B000SDKDM4	A1NE47S8ZJPLR3	Smooth coffee	"My built-in Bosch coffee machine has trouble grinding ""oily"" beans, because they get caught in the chute and don't reach the grinder.<br /><br />When using oily beans, the message ""add beans"" appears even if the hopper is full, and I have to slide out the chasis and stir the beans.<br /><br />The Lavazza beans are ""dry,"" without an oily sheen, and I haven't had any problems making my afternoon espresso, plus the coffee is smooth and there is plenty of cream or crema on top.<br /><br />All in all, a great product at a great price, and retail stores I've visited charge a lot more for the same coffee beans."	0	0
